# Origins of Copilot Workspace

At GitHub Next we work in phases: ideation, build, ship, learn. Every phase is about learning.

In May 2023, after launching Copilot-X, our ideation around the [SpecLang project](https://githubnext.com/projects/speclang/) led to new explorations of how to incorporate natural language — and user edits to natural language — into the development process. SpecLang is conceptualized as a compiler for natural language: specs are _permanent_, and code _ephemeral_. But what would happen when specs are updated — is the compilation function stable enough? That led us to ask: what if instead code was _permanent_, and specs _ephemeral_? Can the user then change the spec, and see the inferred changes to the code? This led to a new ideation: _Extract, Edit, Apply_ — EEA. We would use AI models to _extract_ a specification from existing code, the user would indicate the desired change by _editing_, and the AI would help _apply_ that change.

From June 2023 to GitHub Universe in November 2023 and through to technical preview in April 2024, this ideation merged with many other practical and new themes and become Copilot Workspace. We began to focus on issues and tasks as the source of change intent. We looked at validation and the possibilities to incorporate AI-assisted build and validation cycles. We did user studies and learned more about the many ways we could support iteration after initial code generation. We looked at extensibility and “developer flow” integration. We experimented with AI inference for working out what files — and what parts of files — to change. We integrated a terminal and file synchronizer for practical validation. We learned about the joy of natural language programming on mobile devices — drafting issues and then “Open in Workspace”. We iterated on conceptual on models of the development process and did interviews to understand how developers experience and use Chat-based AI in their work today. We began to understand more of the social role of sharing “sessions” — early drafts of possible code changes. We also learned how Copilot Workspace helps as much when the developer is unfamiliar with a codebase as familiar. We worked hard, very hard, on the user interface. And we used the tool ourselves a lot — so-called “dogfooding” — a lot, every day.

We're excited to continue this development and to take the journey through technical preview, always with the aim to learn even more about this space.
