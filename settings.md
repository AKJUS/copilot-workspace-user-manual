# Copilot Workspace Settings

These settings are preferences for how you want Copilot Workspace to behave with your workflows.

## Collapse timeline on implement

When this setting is enabled, the timeline panel on the left side of the workspace will automatically collapse after you click the "Implement" button. This allows you to focus more on the code changes and less on the timeline, while still being able to revise with natural language.

## Spin up a codespace when a session is created

When this setting is enabled, a Codespace will be automatically created when you start a new session. This provides a full development environment with language services, making it easier to work on your tasks. Note that selecting this option may cause code generated by Copilot Workspace to be executed before you are able to review it. By selecting this, you acknowledge the risks of auto-running AI-generated code.
